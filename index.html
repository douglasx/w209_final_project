        So, I decided to base my first Assignment 1 on Screentime from the iPhone.
        I use it for many things such as video games, reddit, email, social networking/watching videos.
        However, I have been trying to curb my screen time since the beginning of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Saturday, the 14th, I played an excessive amount of time on games and deleted the app from my phone.
      </p>
        You can see that by my decision on Saturday, I have been actively trying to reduce screen time. A majority of my time was spent on video games, but now I am also trying to reduce my screen time in other categories. I can see that my reading time is approximately 1 hour a day, so a better opportunity to reduce would be in social networking.
        <p>

        A good next plan would be to add a limit on the amount of time I can spend on an app with the app blocker.
</p><p>
        P.S. I think this screen time is excessive especially since I'm doing data analysis all day and staring at a laptop haha.
