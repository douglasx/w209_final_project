            Modern Mass Shootings are happening every year and becoming more prevalent in the news every year. News sources tend to bias and scare people into thinking things are happening more often. Our purpose is to let you decide your own opinion and see unbiased facts/comparisons. 
            <br>
            Mass shootings are typically shown in the news with extra bias to where there are articles on “Are more mass shootings committed by white males?” The purpose of this is to make you come to conclusions by yourself, though we will offer our insights as to why certain issues are more complicated.
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Modify Mass shooting definition
            <br>
            Mass shootings are defined by the FBI as "mass murder" as "four or more murdered during an event with no "cooling-off period" between the murders." However, this encapsulates a lot of other events that are not reported on in the media, so we’ve decided to provide visualizations which will allow you to enter your own definition of a mass murder.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Remove Mass shooting related biases
            <br>
            By defining your own way of looking at the mass shooting data, we are trying to remove the biases that news media usually have on mass shooting, the potential causes, and the potential fix to reduce the number of incidents.

        <p>Below you will see a visualization that shows you the number of mass shootings each year and you can enter your own number to see how this affects the visualization. The minimum starting number is 4, but you can go all the way up to XX. You can also see how the racial demographics of shooters changes when you modify the definition of mass shootings.</p>

        <p>1. The main graph is going to be a time history of the mass shooting, then should we overlay it with a racial demographic distribution for each year, Or put a second time history just below to show the racial demographic. My feeling is that using overlay might make it easier to compare. </p>
